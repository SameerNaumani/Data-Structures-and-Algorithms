    "The goal of this lab is to explore recursion. In excercise one we utilize turtle library to recursively draw out a tree. The tree was mapped out using randomized angle value parameters for right and left traces as well as recursive branch length. The second excercise asks to solve various porblems using recursion. The first problem asked for implementing the power function using tail recursive. The second problem was an enhanced version of this function. The final problem was implementing binomial coefficients using recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall the first excercise took a lot of time but overall the lab enhanced understanding of recursion."
